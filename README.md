This program finds crease patterns in a foldable grid.

- `lattice.py` - Fold a stamp grid given a size as the program arguments.
- `mirua_ori.py` - Example for the miura ori given a size as the program arguments.
- `triangle.py` - A crease pattern with no locally flat foldable edge assignments

This program is extremely slow, but I think its cool.
